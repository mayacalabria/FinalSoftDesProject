FUNCTIONS
    calc_all_zone_percentage(shots, season='2017-18')
        Takes a pandas DataFrame of a players shots and the season to calculate
        their shooting percentage by zone, returns a dictionary of the players zone
        percentage minus the league average percentage for that zone

    calc_zone_frequency(shots, basic_zone, zone_area, zone_range)
        takes a dataframe of shot data and returns a dictionary with each
        zones relative frequency

    calc_zone_percentage(shots, zone_area, zone_range, basic_zone)
        calculates an individual zone percentage in a dataframe of shot data

    draw_court(fig_obj, line_width=3, line_color='black', line_alpha=1)
        takes a bokeh hex plot figure object and draws court lines over
        the figure

    full_heat_map(shots, display=True)
        Creates heat map of all attempted shots from a pandas structure

    generate_scatter(shots)
        Creates scatter plot of all shots taken by player over season

    generate_shots(first, last=None, season='2017-18')
        Takes first, last, and season as string,
        returns pandas structure of all shots from locally stored
        data CSVs

    generate_shots_fromNBA(first, last, season)
        Takes first, last, and season as string,
        returns pandas structure of all shots

    generate_team_shots(team_abv, season='2017-18')
        Takes first, last, and season as string,
        returns pandas structure of all shots from locally stored
        data CSVs

    hex_plot_player(shots)
        Takes pandas DataFrame of shots and creates Bokeh hex plot,hex_plot_player_freq(shots)
        Takes pandas DataFrame of shots and creates Bokeh hex plot,
        optional binsize, controls resolution

    hex_plot_team(shots)
        Takes pandas DataFrame of shots and creates Bokeh hex plot,
        optional binsize, controls resolution

    hex_plot_team_freq(shots)
        Takes pandas DataFrame of shots and creates Bokeh hex plot,
        optional binsize, controls resolution

    hist_heat(shots, bin_size=60)
        Uses matplotlib to generate a 2D histogram and display heat map

    league_average(season=None, first='Kevin', last='Durant')
        Generates the leage averages by zone for the given season
        default value for first/last name is Kevin Durant, but any player
        could be used to initialize the ShotChart class from nba_py
        takes season as a string and defaults to current season

        returns: Pandas DataFrame

    sort_all_bins(shots)

    sort_all_bins_freq(shots)

    sort_hex_bin(shots, zone_area, zone_range, basic_zone)
        given 3 parameters to define a zone output all of the x,y position data
        for that zone

    sort_hex_bin_freq(shots, zone_area, zone_range, basic_zone)
        given 3 parameters to define a zone output all of the x,y position data
        for that zone

    sort_successes(shots)
        Takes a pandas DataFrame of a players shots and returns a data set
        with only shots that were successful

    success_heat_map(shots, display=True)
        Creates heat map of all made shots from a pandas structure
